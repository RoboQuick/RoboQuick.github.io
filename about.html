<p> Our primary mission goal – measure air temperature and pressure up to 1 km altitude.</p>

<p>We will analyse the acquired data, to see how the measurements change depending on the height. We will also use this data to find out, if we are able to precisely predict the weather from our obtained data.</p>

<p class="mb-5">If our findings are useful, it would show that similar devices could be used to quickly predict weather, in places where it is difficult to do so using only ground-based devices.</p>
